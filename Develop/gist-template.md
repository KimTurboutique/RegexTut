Regex: regular expressions are patterns used to search through a string of text, it can check if a string contains a certain letter or phrase. It can also be used for matching, and manipulating strings of text based on a specific pattern. Regex patterns can be used for other tasks such as validation, text extraction, and data transformation.

## Summary

## Regex Components

The different types of regex components are based on their purpose and the kind of matches/seaches they are designed to perform.

### Anchors

Anchors define the positions in the text. For example '^' matches the start of a line or string.

### Quantifiers

These specify how many times a character or group should occur. For example in my regex above I used the '+' which matches one or more occurences.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping contracts- group expressions together and captures matched text for later use by using parentheses for example '(abc)'.

### Bracket Expressions

Allows you to define a set of characters that should match a single character at a specific position in the text using square brackets '[. . .]'. They are crucial components of regex also known as character classes in the example above I used this to match simple characters [ esm] it matched characters 'e','s', or 'm' in my test paragraph.

### Character Classes

Are the same as bracket expressions. There are different explanations: 1.Simple Character Classes, 2.Negated Character Classes, 3.Combining Character Classes, 4.Escaping Within Character Classes, 5.Special Characters Within Character Classes, etc. They provide you with versatile ways to define sets of characters.
